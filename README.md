# buying-and-selling-goods
Hi!
The project you see is a site for buying and selling goods, where you can put products for sale or buy the products available on the site.

Features and capabilities of this project:

- You can put any number of products for sale on the site (you must register and then log in to be able to put an item)
- There is an inbox section where you can see the products you have put up for sale
- You can delete and edit your items or specify completion or availability (it is the responsibility of the seller to specify the completion or availability of the product)
- You can comment under other products
- To sell your product, there is a button under the products that the buyer can click on to send you a message and contact you to buy.
- Both the seller and the buyer can see the received and sent messages for each product in the rooms section

  All these items require registration
